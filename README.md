# rkextreme-auto-pillar
Auto contact pillars as soon as they spawn on RK9 extreme last boss.

Disabled by default, type pillar to enable the mod.

You can decide which pillars to auto contact, type setpillar and a value from 1 to 5.

Example: setpillar 1 to enable auto contact pillar 1.

All pillars are disabled by default.
If you want to auto contact all pillars, just type

setpillar 1

setpillar 2

setpillar 3

setpillar 4

setpillar 5


or just modify the code and set p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 to true

You can dc sometimes if you contact all 5 pillars due to the large amount of tps on such a short time, try out yourself.

Enjoy.
